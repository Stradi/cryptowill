In 60 days, a payer can always confirms that he/she is not dead. When payer confirms that he/she is not dead, all the current payees are removed. If payer does not confirms he/she is not dead, Crypto Will will change it's state to dead state and his/her payee's can withdraw the shares using **Withdraw Funds** panel.
